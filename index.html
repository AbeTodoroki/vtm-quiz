        'Banu Haqim': `The Judges of the Banu Haqim are torn between their hereditary thirst for vampiric Blood and their passion for justice.
         Stern adjudicators, they are fiercely devoted to upholding a moral code, and Embrace mortals capable of assessing and handling threats, enforcing laws and traditions, and punishing transgressors.
         Regardless of the individual Banu Haqim's stance, they all adhere to some type of strict code, be it blood laws, personal ethics, governmental or religious rules.
         Nevertheless, that doesn't mean they are free of self-interest, and often such codes of conduct are a self-regulation method to keep in check their desire for Kindred blood.
         The Banu Haqim's instinct to find the guilty is intrinsic to the Blood and not bound by religion; those guilty of whatever transgression a Child of Haqim deems unforgivable must be punished, and punishment might even include taking their unlife from their veins through diablerie.
         They are also not tied to a specific cultural or geographical background, and modern Banu Haqim hail from all over the world, representing various beliefs.
         Their individual code is also not necessarily tied to a faith, and may come from personal convictions rather than religion.

        'Brujah': `The Brujah are a clan of radicals and troublemakers, Embracing those willing to put someone in their place if the situation calls for it.
         Most see themselves as warriors with a cause, and these Rebels are guided by their passions, strength, and dedication to their ideals — whatever those may be.
         Brujah are generally Embraced from the ranks of those who are sympathetic to those who do not back down.
         Seeking out others who question the status quo and welcome countercultures.
         From spirited fighters to critical thinkers, the clan is bolstered by their ability to withstand the storm and persevere through hardships.
         The Brujah are commonly misplaced as the street punks or anarchists who are looking for nothing but trouble.
         However, this is far from the truth.
        `,
        'Gangrel': `Often closer to beasts than other vampires, and so the Gangrel style themselves apex predators.
         These Ferals prowl the wilds as easily as the urban jungle, and no clan of vampires can match their ability to endure, survive, and thrive in any environment.
         Often fiercely territorial, their shapeshifting abilities even give the undead pause.
         Gangrels are generally embraced from prospects who show the ability to survive and fighters.
         Due to this their customs encourage fights for dominance but not to final death as they push for a culture of healthy rivalry rather than taking competition personally.
         They are usually the outcasts of Kindred society, learning to live in undesirable areas and yet thrive without bending the knee to a Prince or Baron.
         Gangrels tend to care less about appearances and status than they do about action and accomplishments.
        `,
        'Hecata': `A motley collection of necromantic vampire bloodlines, the Hecata clan are united in the pursuit of a single subject: Death.
         They are students of the afterlife and resurrectionists of the dead — or worse.
         Selling their services to the highest bidder, or acting in their own interests, there are few who can hide from the surveillance of those who can summon and command the very spirits of the deceased.
         A clan steeped in death, they practice the arts of necromancy and communication with the dead.
         The clan tends to favour mortals either from their own mortal family or those with useful connections to other outside families.
         It is speculated that the reason all Hecata share the same Disciplines unlike their ancestors is caused by the unification of the necromantic bloodlines that formed clan Hecata and the destruction of so many Giovanni elders.
         With the nature of their bane, the Hecata have developed methods to feed safely.
         Through blood bags and corpses or extracting blood from their victims without the use of their fangs.
         They have a habit of feeding on herds or from members of their own family, however this brings strife as resentment and fear builds between them.
         In more recent years, the clan has formed a unique bond with the Circulatory System, to obtain mute or comatose vessels.
        `,
        'Lasombra': `Creatures subtly at odds with mundane reality, Lasombra vampires are expected to triumph at any cost.
         Ruthlessness is a sought-after trait in progeny, making their reputation as betraying interlopers well deserved.
         Most do not seek attention, preferring to act as puppeteers, powers behind the proverbial throne.
         To a Shadow, the ends justify any means.
         The Lasombra rarely have time for the weak, with a perspective that the only way to survive is to excel.
         Sympathy and morality do nothing but weigh them down and prevent their inevitable climb to power.
         They generally Embrace those who fought against the odds and came out on top, those who survive dangerous situations or otherwise exemplify excellence.
         Their childer tend to be targeted towards those who are fit for something beyond mortal life, such as sociopaths, deviants or other scarred survivors.
         The Magisters also tend to lean heavily into organized religion to find their new prospective, however they are not looking for the truly faithful or depraved souls, instead they seek out those who arose to power in the church from a desire to have complete control.
         Priests, nuns, monks, vicars or rabbis who have used their congregation as a tool to bolster their power.
        `,
        'Malkavian': `Derided as Lunatics by other vampires, the Blood of the Malkavians lets them perceive and foretell truths hidden from others.
         Like the “wise madmen” of poetry their fractured perspective stems from seeing too much of the world at once, from understanding too deeply, and feeling emotions that are just too strong to bear.
         Their Embraces come from all walks of life and age, with most Embraces carries something that was only visible to the sire.
         One the gifts sought is called the "Second Sight" or, the ability to understand dreams, perceive spirits or predict the future to some successful degree.
         The second gift is that of "insight", otherwise known as someone who is highly empathetic up to finely-tuned knowledge of a subject.
         Due to this many of the clan come from professions in academics or doctors.
         Lastly, they hold interest in those they deem "broken" by traumatic events.
         Due to these traits and their general instability, most Kindred never feel comfortable around a known Malkavian, often viewing them as unpredictable who is rarely worth the effort.
         Some Children of Malkav claim that there is a common trait they all share.
         Believed to be connected through a psychic link, a wavelength of sorts called the Cobweb or more recently titled the Network.

        'Ministry': `The Ministry always has something to offer.
         This often cult-like clan recruits those able to employ temptation as a weapon.
         They Embrace those with the will and means to sway, entrap, and ultimately liberate their targets from whatever they seek: the victim’s possessions, allegiance, or even faith.
         To the Serpents, everything has a price.
         The clan was formerly known as the Followers of Set.
         For as much as a cult as they are a clan, the majority of their members adhere to a disruptive system of beliefs.
         They are known as as a group of the devious type, tricksters, tempters and liars.
         Due to this their relationships in the modern age and in the past are rocky at best, given their tendencies to play all sides during major conflicts.
         Their entry into the Camarilla was rejected, leaving most to side up with the Anarchs.
         With the creed not forced upon their childer, that does not stop their lineage from influencing them and enticing them to gravitate towards the propensity for subterfuge and attraction.
         Many of the clan keep vast libraries, making a nightly hunt to gather ancient documents or artifacts to study and bring to the cult.
         While others take a less direct route to liberate subjects on a more personal level rather than religious.
         Time is no matter to them, as often they'll wait months in order to properly sink their claws into their target with all the right forbidden vices.
        `,
        'Nosferatu': `The Nosferatu wear their curse on the outside.
         Their bodies horribly twisted and deformed through the Embrace, they lurk on the fringes of most cities, acting as spies and brokers of information.
         Using animals and their own supernatural capacity to hide, nothing escapes the eyes of the so-called Sewer Rats.
         Their Embrace is one of the most painful, twisting and deforming their body into something else forever to be stuck as a monster.
         The entire transformation process can take weeks and result in deformities similar to birth defects, growths, severe injuries, or, sores; leaving the unlucky as hideous monsters or normal looking humans with conditions.
         Regardless of their monstrous appearance, they are often some of the most compassionate kindred from wearing their curse on the outside rather than inside.
         To blend in some will use their abilities within Obfuscate or heavy make-up and prosthetics.
         Some believe that when trouble is about to come knocking, it's best to slink down into the underground and sewers to avoid detection.
         Sending others to report into the tower rather than face the Camarilla themselves and be caught out by the hunters storming or being faced by their beautiful counterparts.
         The Second Inquisition have noted that this clan lingers around social outcasts, building rapport with them and earning their compassion in trade to better hide from the hunters.
         The Nosferatu have taken to communicating via codes and dead languages through several sources to not be tracked after the fall of their ARPANET station, SchreckNET.
        `,
        'Ravnos': `Masters of misdirection, the Ravnos prefer not to fight or bleed for something they can obtain through subtler means.
         They can charm and vanish within the same mortal breath, and those once fooled quickly learn to question their very senses when in the company of Ravens.
         Always on the move, the Ravnos can never rest in the same place for long lest their curse light them on fire as they slumber.
         They were almost annihilated during the beginning act of the Gehenna War during the Week of Nightmares but with time is now growing stronger once more.
         They may be known as wandering Kindred, those utilized to bring messages or as those who wish to do nothing else but mess with the minds of others.
         Generally they move across the lands, rarely settling down in attempt to remain one step ahead of the judgement that runs through their veins.
         Their methods are not usually those of brute force, gaining adoring fans or overdrawn plans that take centuries to complete.
         Instead most Ravnos rely on their wits, clever charm and illusions.
         They prefer not to bleed when able, using more subtle methods to obtain whatever it is they desire.
         For this reason it is rare they make their true nature known and once they have, they disappear into the night as quickly as they appeared.
         In order to combat this curse, those that do remain within certain regions do well to set up multiple havens and don multiple masks.
         No clan is as skilled as the Haunted when it comes to blending into society, be it mortal or Kindred.
         Due to the mistrust they may face, some display themselves as Caitiff in order to find a place within Kindred society, but those who do not and show their true colors often take an Autarkis standpoint and sell their services to others.
         Maintaining this, however, is difficult and most eventually pack up and leave either due to a collection of enemies or the doomed blood burning them as they rest.
        `,
        'Salubri': `Most of their kind lost to undead usurpers, the highly desirable Blood of the hunted Salubri is a prize to other vampires.
         This, and their reluctance to Embrace, makes them rare in the modern nights.
         They often recruit those on the edge of death, believing their curse can provide the worthy a second chance, and they count some of the most humane vampires among their ranks.
         Once known for their wisdom and knowledge, the clan barely exists these nights.
         Their legacy is one of tragedy and a painful lesson of the eternal struggle.
         Their childer are few in the modern nights; as per their customs, they generally only embrace once they've reached Golconda, even though this is only speculation given the current state of Kindred affairs.
         The choice of a childe for the Salubri is an intensely personal decision in comparison to other clans.
         They usually desire those with inquisitive behaviors and personal struggles within them.
         Salubri rarely embrace on a mere whim.
         Choosing a childe who has a problem which they must then solve for themselves, be it terminal illness or an unquenchable drive to right a wrong done to them.
         It is believed that Saulot, their progenitor, was devoured by a Tremere to strengthen his own clan's Blood.
         It is also believed that Saulot was the first Kindred to ever reach Golconda, and so his lineage still attempts to walk in that same path centuries after his death.
         More often than not, the Salubri lead troubled lives, only burdened more by the eternal life they've been given and a third eye, which each Salubri has.
         Still, they persevere to solve the mystery of Caine's damnation and help others find their salvation.
         However, the power to help comes with the power to harm, and many Kindred believe in the rumors of these Cyclops being able to steal their souls.
         Some Salubri even take a hard stance of desiring to destroy those too entangled with their beast or keep their distance from other Kindred has done nothing but solidify the speculations about them.
         Very few domains allow them within their walls because they are running into trouble with others; neither Camarilla Princes nor Anarch Barons are willing to keep them long.
         Many of the Salubri are still being hunted for actions of their sires centuries ago.
         Their fate in the modern night is grim.
         Still, they face this adversity with a perspective rare within Kindred.
         Willing to help others walk the difficult path of Golconda, plenty of Salubri seems to want to help others rather than cause strife.
         Others seek to protect them in other ways by hunting down wights and other low humanity monsters that plague Kindred and cause nothing but problems.
        `,
        'Toreador': `Known for their seductive nature, enthralling demeanor, and eloquent grace to the point of obsession, Toreador vampires Embrace artists and lovers into their ranks, forever trying to stir their own deadened hearts.
         Supernaturally graceful and charming, the Divas are always looking for the next thrill, leaving a detritus of discarded lovers and victims in their wake.
         A clan who exudes beauty, one who seeks out the aesthetics in life and holds their obsessions with it.
         However, it is a mistake to think of them as nothing but Divas and perverts.
         Beauty is power and the way they utilize love to influence those around them to do just about anything is an invaluable weapon.
         The elders of their clan stress that the Embrace must be given to those worthy and that the clan seeks out pioneers of different arts.
         The clan prospers when it's filled with fresh ideas and those who value experimentation and discovery of new aesthetics.
         Because of this trait, this clan is riddled with a wide range of artists.
         However, to the Toreador, art is not only done with paint or a pencil.
         Actors, singers, poets, and more fill in their ranks as long as they are viewed to be bringing something new to the table.
         And although they seek out the best of the best, it's not unheard of for one of the Hedonists to embrace another in a moment of weakness and haste.
         Creating a subpar childe after the pool of blood that they died in was too beautiful to let them go.
         Still, the clan holds its diversity between talent, beauty, and other core traits their sire found as an asset.
        `,
        'Tremere': `The arcane Clan Tremere were once a house of mortal mages who sought immortality but found only undeath.
         As vampires, they’ve perfected ways to bend their own Blood to their will, employing their sorceries to master and ensorcel both the mortal and vampire world.
         Their power makes them valuable, but few vampires trust their scheming ways.
         Tremere was once the name of an eight-century Romanian hermetic mage, obsessed with knowledge and power.
         This obsession allowed him to prolong his lifespan beyond the mortal timeframe, but eventually, his power weakened, and in turn, he became unwilling to accept his mortality.
         From his greed, he instigated terrifying magical experiments which damned him and his followers.
         Thousands of mortals and hundreds of Kindreds were murdered in the experimentation and ritualistic practices to find the elixir of life.
         These actions eventually unveiled the curse of Caine, entering him and his followers into an eternity of unlife and hunger, unable to use practice their craft.
         Tremere and followers were able to use Blood Sorcery to imitate their old magic and organized their newly turned clan.
         The Tremere were once possibly the most organized clan by virtue of their Pyramid, a strict hierarchy with the Blood Bond and oaths enforcing loyalty so power was concentrated at the top and trickled down.
         They had ranks and chantries who all answered to the Council of Seven, who sat atop the Pyramid.
        `,
        'Tzimisce': `The dragons view ownership above all, they aim to conquer and rule the subject of their possessiveness.
         Traditionally their charges were based on geographical locations, hence the stereotype of a vampire in a looming castle.
         However, in the modern age, the younger generations have taken a more loose approach, staking claim over mortals rather than their land.
         Their desire to own is only limited by their lack of expansion, but once they've sunk their claws in they are hard to shake loose.
         These possessive traits extend beyond others and property and into their own body.
         Many dragons specialize in a form of Protean known as Vicissitude which allows them to alter their bodies how they deem fit, including the bodies of others willing or not.
         These Tzimisce go beyond just the physical perfectionism and lean into the metaphysical and stretch the very limits of vampirism itself.
         Transforming their bodies into statues, or altering the traits of gender, reaching as far as to create groups of mortal lookalikes to subsume their individuality.
         Some tales even speak of Dragons going as far as to become one with their haven, merging into the soil of their domain.
         This, of course, creates a divide between the older and younger Tzimisce where the younger have had less time to cultivate their ownership while the other doubles their control.
         It's no surprise to hear that the Tzimisce were active participants in the Anarch Revolt and were one of the founding clans of the Sabbat.
         Even tonight, with the Sabbat shattered, others are wary of them and their cunning abilities.
         With the elders controlling so much, many younger members are driven from the Black Hand and towards the Anarchs to redefine themselves and their charges.
         A few Tzimisce find comfort within the Camarilla, finding a familiar comfort in its neo-feudalism even if the tower itself has little love for them.
        `,
        'Ventrue': `The Ventrue are not called the Clan of Kings for nothing.
         Carefully choosing their progeny from mortals familiar with power, wealth, and influence, the Ventrue style themselves the aristocrats of the vampire world.
         Their members are expected to assume command wherever possible, and they’re willing to endure storms for the sake of leading from the front.
         To them, they are the rightful heirs of power and command.
         The Ventrue have held more positions of power than any other clan; as god-kings in ancient Babylon to majority shareholders and campaign fund backers in the modern age, they've held their footing as long as they could.
         Though in recent nights their status has begun to slip, many Ventrue feel their time is running out and as their privileges slip through their fingers, most Ventrue tighten their grasp, willing to fight fang and claw to keep hold.
         Clan Ventrue has long been the leader of the Camarilla, even after losing their most prominent representative, Hardestat, to a Brujah assassination.
         A majority of the clan believes that the strength of tradition and lineage is what holds them above the rest.
         Though these nights they are careful, blending into humanity behind the scenes.
         Resentment is building from having to control the strings from behind the curtain, but curtailing the Masquerade and possible breaches that would follow should they not is crucial.
         Even outside of business they function as if one.
         They are the establishment that so many aims to destroy.
         They set and maintain the rules, they punish those who do not keep them with the occasional treat for those who do.
         Those who do not like their methods call them tyrants for keeping Kindred down.
         However, without them, the Camarilla and in turn, the Masquerade would have fallen long ago.
